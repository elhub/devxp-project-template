# Reporting Security Issues

The Elhub development teams take security bugs in our systems seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly
disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

* If it is possible, please use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/elhub/elhub/security/advisories/new)
  tab to report the vulnerability or issue that you have found.
* If the GitHub security advisory is not available, send an e-mail to
  [post@elhub.no](mailto:post@elhub.no?subject=Security%20Advisory).
* Elhub employees should follow the internal Elhub security incident routines.

Include as much details as you can in your message. The security team will send you a response indicating any next
steps required to handle your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed
of the progress towards a fix and potential announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Securing an Application

Developers working on an Elhub application MUST adhere to the guidelines of the Elhub Security Playbook. Note that,
at this time, this is an internal document.
